This was built to accompany the reading as a visual. A new line appears after every third keystroke. This was done to mimmic typing the code as part of the performance while eliminating the chance of a typo or slowing down the pace of the reading. Only the first line is read on lines with mutiple sentences.

Annotation by Line:  
1. The medium is twitter. An Allusion to Marshall McLuhan’s “The medium is the message. With twitter as the medium, the user knows the content is often whimsical blurbs with real talk sprinkled in.  
2. The medium is essential to end result ( and to the code running properly )  
3-8. Not read, setting up the twitter client/medium ( obvious to people that speak code )  
10. Virtues is an empty list. Creating a blank slate for the reader & the machine. Is the symbol for an array in ruby but ruby abstracts lists away from the machine and presents them as an array. Very legible, looks like an empty book to the non pragmatic eye.  
11-17. All of the figures were chosen because they all have a massive following and are "worshipped" in a sense by their respective following.  
11. Elon Musk’s text is added to the list of virtues  
12. Lebron James’ text is added to the list of virtues  
13. The pope’s text is added to the list of virtues  
14. Kim Jong Un’s text is added to the list of virtues  
15. Beyonce’s text is added to the list of virtues  
16. Richard Branson’s text is added to the list of virtues  
17. God’s text is added to the list of virtues  
18. A comment in the code. A break in the pace. To be read as is without the # ( the # tells the machine not to run the code )  
19. Faraday gets the body of zen and adds it to the list of virtues ( Faraday is the name of a library used to make an external request to an API that provides random insights to zen. Faraday is also a reference to Michael Faraday, the English scientist that discovered magnetism could bend light.  
22. File open the prophets manifesto text and write ( actually opens or creates a file named prophets_manifesto.txt on the machine and readies it to be written to )  
23. Virtues. Each truth outputs truth ( Actually writes the list of virtues that we added to, line by line, to the prophet_manifesto.txt file mentioned in the previous line.  
24. Ends the machine writing to the file. Debatable as to whether or not is should be read.  
26. System, open the prophets manifesto ( Actually opens and displays the text on the users machine )
